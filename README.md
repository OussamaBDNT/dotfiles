## Dotfiles? How do you eat that?

### In my odyssey to have the perfect dotfiles I have come across the profiles of many other people with the same objective and these two summaries of "what are dotfiles" are the ones I liked the most

#### In [Xero's](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles) words:

- In the \*nix world programs are commonly configured in two different ways, via shell arguments or text-based configuration files. Programs with many options like window managers or text editors are configured on a per-user basis with files in your home directory `~`. In unix-like operating systems any file or directory name that starts with a period or full stop character is considered hidden, and in a default view will not be displayed, thus the name dotfiles. 

It's been said of every console user: 
> _"You are your dotfiles."_

#### In [Ayekat's](https://github.com/ayekat/dotfiles) words:

- This is my collection of user/application settings ("dotfiles") and personal scripts. They are mostly adapted to my personal needs, and some scripts make a few assumptions about the environment that may not necessarily be considered "standard", so **it's not recommended** to just copy-paste them as-is.

- Nevertheless, I try to keep them as clean and non-WTF as possible, and people are invited to take a look at them, get ideas for their own dotfiles, and drop comments, suggestions, questions and bug reports if something seems odd.

#### And in my own words: 

You must already have a basic idea of what dotfiles are, so I won't focus on explaining what they are but how they differ from other dotfiles:

- My dotfiles are characterized by the fact that I try to be as minimalist and _non-bloated_ as possible, this can be confirmed by seeing with which tools I work on a daily basis (Neovim, i3, bspwm, Arch Linux, ncmpcpp, aurutils, rofi, zathura, pass, st (simple/suckless terminal), etc.) and the fact of how I use them and how I configure them to my liking. Clearly, there are going to be some exceptions to this rule (Firefox, SystemD, PulseAudio etc.) but I do what I can to also be as comfortable as possible. 
So, you can think of this repository as a little guide to build your own minimalist workflow (if you're one of those people who likes this), and if you're one of those people who hates minimalism, you might find something really useful if you know how to look.

### Other things i use and recommend

* For desktop blurrying: Ganifladi's excellent `blurme` → [Blurme](https://github.com/ganifladi/blurme)
* To have icons in `polybar`: `ttf-font-awesome-4` → [Font Awesome 4](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-font-awesome-4/) **Font Awesome 5 does not work properly with Polybar. Or at least it doesn't work like Font Awesome 4.** 
* To vote for all your packages downloaded from the AUR: `aurvote` → [AURvote](https://github.com/archlinuxfr/aurvote) 
Use it this way: ```$ aurvote -v $(pacman -Qqm) ``` - **Only for Arch Linux users.**
* To retrieve and filter the latest Pacman mirror list and the best servers available: `reflector` → [Reflector](https://xyne.archlinux.ca/projects/reflector/) - **Only for Arch Linux users.**

## Installation

### Before installing, be sure to read useful cowboy [gently-worded note](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles#heed-this-critically-important-warning-before-you-install) and this excellent article by Anish Athalye: [Dotfiles are NOT meant to be forked](http://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/). That said, let's go with the installation:

1. **Install GNU Stow:** GNU Stow is available for all GNU+Linux distros and most other unix-like distributions via your package manager.

- `sudo pacman -S stow`
- `sudo apt-get install stow`
- `brew install stow`


2. **Clone this repo:**

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/davidarrieta/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles
```

3. **Symlink with GNU Stow all the folders you want to your home:** To install most of my dotfiles you execute `stow` with the folder name as the only argument. 
For example, to install my `i3` and my `zshrc` config use the command:

```sh
$ stow i3 
$ stow zsh 
$ stow whatever-dotfile-you-want
```
This will symlink files to `~/.config/i3/` `~/.zshrc` and various other places.

- **If you have an existing dotfiles repo and you want to make your own dotfiles stow-compatible you must learn how to arrange your files right so that `stow` can link them correctly, here are some helpful links:**
[Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) - [Managing dotfiles with GNU stow](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/)
